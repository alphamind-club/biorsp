# BioRSP: Biological Radar Scanning Plot

BioRSP is an advanced tool developed to enhance the analysis of single-cell gene expression data within embedding spaces generated by dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP. By simulating radar scanning, BioRSP systematically analyzes gene expression across various cell clusters, providing both qualitative and quantitative insights:

- It introduces **Radar Scanning Plots (RSPs)**, which visually capture gene expression patterns from multiple angles, highlighting variations across clusters.
- BioRSP also computes metrics such as the **RSP area**, **Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)**, and **deviation scores**, categorizing gene expression patterns into distinct groups.

This comprehensive approach improves the detection of cellular heterogeneity and helps distinguish between general expression patterns and key biomarker expression levels, making it a crucial tool for gene expression research.

## Installation

Currently, BioRSP is available as a working package in this repository. You can download the latest stable version from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/cytronicoder/biorsp/releases). More information about installing bioRSP will be provided in the future.

In the future, we plan to release BioRSP as a standalone package on PyPI for easier installation. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cytronicoder/biorsp/issues).
