# Note on the tutorials

These tutorials are for learning the bioRSP module. They are not intended to be used for any other purpose. In fact, some of the tutorials utilize legacy code that might not be compatible with the current version of bioRSP.

In other words, you can learn how bioRSP works by reading these tutorials. However, you should not use these tutorials for any other purpose.

Currently, some parts of the package in `src` might not work as intended. That is expected; I am currently working on refactoring them to make them more user-friendly and easier to use. Additionally, I am working on adding more features to the package, and that means occasional outdated methods might be present in the package. If you find any of the methods in the tutorials (or any other part of the package in `src`) to be outdated or does not work, please let me know in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cytronicoder/biorsp/issues).

We will update these tutorials in the future. For now, please use them as a reference to understand how bioRSP works. Thanks!
